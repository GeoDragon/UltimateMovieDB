To Use This App: <br/>
You will need to add your very own TMDB API Key to use the App.<br/>
1. Get your own API_KEY from https://www.themoviedb.org/ <br/>
2. Open gradle.properties <br/>
3. Replace the "Your API Key" with your new obtained API Key. <br/>
  (You will need the "" so your final API Key would look something like: <br/>
    MyTheMovieDBApiKey = "aswd876t8wqgasdb" <br/>
    Random Fake data. Won't work. Go to Step 1 to make it work). <br/>
    <br/>
Simple as that.<br/>
<br/>    
Enjoy the app :)<br/>
Star it if you like it.<br/>
