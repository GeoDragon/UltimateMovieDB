To Use This App:
You will need to add your very own TMDB API Key to use the App.
1. Get your own API_KEY from https://www.themoviedb.org/
2. Open gradle.properties
3. Replace the "Your API Key" with your new obtained API Key.
  (You will need the "" so your final API Key would look something like:
    MyTheMovieDBApiKey = "aswd876t8wqgasdb"
    Random Fake data. Won't work. Go to Step 1 to make it work).
    
Simple as that.
    
Enjoy the app :)
Star it if you like it.
